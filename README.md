## For SemSegBench go to [semantic_segmentation](https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/benchmarking_reliability_generalization/tree/main/semantic_segmentation) folder.
The semantic segmentation code is based on [mmsegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation).

## For DetecBench go to [object_detection folder](https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/benchmarking_reliability_generalization/tree/main/object_detection).
The object detection code is based on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).
